# Recommender System
Created a Recommender system based on Products of Factors technique

### Data

Use the MovieLens 10 M dataset
[MovieLens](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

### Tasks

- Using MapReduce, design and implement a Recommender System to predict ratings of movies. Base your utility matrix on the Movie Lens 10M dataset.
- The only requirement is that you must use the Products of Factors technique for your system and optimize the loss function using Gradient Descent.
- You are free to add techniques and features to your system. You are also free to use other optimization techniques. We will discuss the solutions in class and award the best one extra credit.
- To evaluate your solution, you must use the shell script provided in MovieLens to generate 5-folds and utilize them to cross-validate your solution.
